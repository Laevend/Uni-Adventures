Hello player. You appear to have ended up in a null room. A room that does not exist in the game...
This is nothing but empty space. Return to the game through the door...

Oh hello there. Welcome to my pathetic excuse for a room. It is very small and has no bloody bathroom! What is this?!
*Sigh* I have 3 pieces of coursework due next week and I have not even started a single one. 2 of them are really boring, they are to do with politics and the media which I cannot even be bothered to go into right now because it's just so dreadfully boring that your head might decapitate itself, roll across the room, and jump out the window.
Well then I better go to my first lab. It's monday and we already have a lab... My timetable is bugged as always, there is a duplicate lab. fml...
